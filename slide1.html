        Our site helps users to know more about where they live. We mean a whole Earth, actually a different countries of our planet. 
        It can seems that there are too general information about some countries, but we personally  know some students who does not know it.
        Also it will be useful as a tool like an atlas for our little brothers and sisters, in order to enter the field of Geography, or update their Horizon.
