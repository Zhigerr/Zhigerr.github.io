    <p style="background-color: rgba(0, 145, 241, 0.5); font-size: xx-large;"> We use almost all HTML queries which we passed in our course. 
        But also we've learned some new things such as adding video directly from YouTube (I released that YouTube has a special link for adding to HTML, which i never seen before),
     Span(May be you showed it in some lecture, but i did not noticed, but anyway i know it now) and so on</p>

<p style="background-color: rgba(0, 145, 241, 0.5); font-size: xx-large;"> Also in CSS we have a same situation with HTML. We use almost all basic technologies which we have learned during the semester.
     But of course among all these technologies we can underline some new and useful things. For example, Transition + Transform.
      This tool helps us to manipulate any thing we want. We can change width,height when mouse click on or just over the object, even change its rotate to any angle. And all these things without JS in few lines of CSS. </p>

    <p style="background-color: rgba(0, 145, 241, 0.5); font-size: xx-large;"> In JavaScripct section, we also use some basic things from teacher's lectures. 
    We use jquery animation, some bootstrap things, and add some basic queries like mouseover, mouseout,onscroll and so on. And learned to call data not only with ID. 
    So, in conclusiom we released that we can manipulate objects on our page almost whatever we want, we just need flexible thinking and a good imagination, also skills using of Google.
